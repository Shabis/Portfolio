			<h2>All About Me:</h2>
				<div>
				<h4>Education</h4>
				<p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.warnerpacific.edu">Warner Pacific College</a> two years ago with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Accounting.</p>
				<h4>Job Experience</h4>
				<p>For the last year I have been working at a tech company as an Accounting Specialist.</p>
				<h4>Why a Prgramming Class?</h4>
				<p>I decided to take this class because I thought that programming would be something I would enjoy. After working for a tech company and seeing what some of our engineers do, I was interested in learning it for myself.</p>
				<h4>Things I like to do in my spare time:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong><em>Reading</em></strong></li>
						<li>Spending time with family</li>
						<li>Travel</li>
					</ul>
